Torrent2LS is a commandline application that can be used to send torrents to your Buffalo(TM) LinkStation Live to be downloaded by the integrated BitTorrent(TM) Download Manager.
It has been tested and works with my LinkStation LS-CHL Firmware 1.07. Your results may vary.

## Requirements
Dotnet Framework 2.0

## Installation
Build it with VisualStudio 2008.
Edit lsip.txt, enter IP adress of target LinkStation
Optional: link .torrent Files to Torrent2LS.exe in the browser of your choice
